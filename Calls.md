Call models represent a call to one or more contacts. A call usually takes place over the phone as a 1:1 or 1:* conference call, but it can also be represented as a Skype call or a Google Hangout as well as any other medium that facilitates voice conversations.  

When assigning contacts to a call it is possible to determine which communication channel is used for that contact. If one is not provided the system will attempt to pick up the default `Phone` channel, and failing that it will pick up the first available 'Phone' channel.
