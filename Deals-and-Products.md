Deals are a sale, real or prospect that is performed with a client.   
A deal can be made of a collection of Products which can be either physical items sold or services.  

### Products

A product can be a physical item or a service provided by the account holder.  The term Product is interchangeable for Service. 
A product contains the basic descriptive fields for what it is as well as defaults for list, sale, wholesale and cost prices. As a product is a Dynamic model, it can also include many other custom fields 
set up by the user.  

When a product is added to a deal it will use, by default, a quantity of 1 and the default sale price set on the product. However those actual values (as well as a note) can be changed at any time. 

### Deals

A deal contains a collection of products that together make up the deal total value.  
Products can be added, removed or edited at any time. A user can add multiples of the same product if required. Those products act as line items in the deal.
