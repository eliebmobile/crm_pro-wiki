Each new account defaults to a collection of settings that can change or affect how the application behaves. Some of those settings can be overridden by individual users to suit their needs.  
Settings are retrieved from the user and will return the account level setting if its not found at the user level.  

### Settings

* `records_per_page`: Number of records to return per page [50]
* `default_phone_country`: Default country code to assume phone numbers are from if not explicitly specified [US]
