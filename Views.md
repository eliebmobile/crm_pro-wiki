Views represent a custom configuration of fields to be presented in grids. 
Each template has its own default view for each type of record. However, a user can save any grid configuration into a view to be recalled later. 

Views are a list of objects in the form of: 

```
[
    {name: 'first_name'},
    {name: 'last_name'},
    {name: 'address'}
    ...
]
```
